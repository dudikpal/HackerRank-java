Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix

is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9

The left-to-right diagonal =
. The right to left diagonal = . Their absolute difference is

.

Function description

Complete the

function in the editor below.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

    int arr[n][m]: an array of integers

Return

    int: the absolute diagonal difference

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer,
, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix .
Each of the next lines describes a row, , and consists of space-separated integers

.

Constraints

Output Format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

Sample Input

3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12

Sample Output

15

Explanation

The primary diagonal is:

11
5
-12

Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

The secondary diagonal is:

     4
5
10

Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15

Note: |x| is the absolute value of x

Comparison Sorting
Quicksort usually has a running time of , but is there an algorithm that can sort even faster? In general, this is not possible. Most sorting algorithms are comparison sorts, i.e. they sort a list just by comparing the elements to one another. A comparison sort algorithm cannot beat (worst-case) running time, since

represents the minimum number of comparisons needed to know where to place each element. For more details, you can see these notes (PDF).

Alternative Sorting
Another sorting method, the counting sort, does not require comparison. Instead, you create an integer array whose index range covers the entire range of values in your array to sort. Each time a value occurs in the original array, you increment the counter at that index. At the end, run through your counting array, printing the value of each non-zero valued index that number of times.

Example
All of the values are in the range , so create an array of zeros,

. The results of each iteration follow:

i	arr[i]	result
0	1	[0, 1, 0, 0]
1	1	[0, 2, 0, 0]
2	3	[0, 2, 0, 1]
3	2	[0, 2, 1, 1]
4	1	[0, 3, 1, 1]

The frequency array is
. These values can be used to create the sorted array as well:

.

Note
For this exercise, always return a frequency array with 100 elements. The example above shows only the first 4 elements, the remainder being zeros.

Challenge
Given a list of integers, count and return the number of times each value appears as an array of integers.

Function Description

countingSort has the following parameter(s):

    arr[n]: an array of integers

Returns

    int[100]: a frequency array

Input Format

The first line contains an integer
